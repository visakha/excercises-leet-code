# About
I have a leet code subscription, this is a place for notes and learnings to remember and share 

# What are the approaches
Most examples and the approach towards solving the leet code challenges emphasis memory and in-place edits over 
 - code readability
 - immutability
 - functional programming

at least when using java.

This is an attempt to solve the leet code challenges with readbility and functional thinking as an approach 

# Chapters
## 1. Implement a data structure that mimics stack with one added functionality : getMin() returna the minimum of the stored value.
### requirement is getMin should have a cost of O(1)

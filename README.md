# Why Immutable objects for the leet code
Most examples and the approach towards solving the leet code challenges emphasis memory and in-place edits over 
 - code readability
 - immutability
 - functional programming

at least when using java.

This is an attempt to solve the leet code challenges with immutability and functional approach as first principle using Java 18 

# 1. Implement a data structure that mimics stack with one added functionality : getMin() return the minimum of the stored value
